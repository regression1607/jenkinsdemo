# Jenkins Pipeline with GitHub Integration

In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up a Jenkins pipeline with GitHub integration to automate the deployment process.

## Step 1: Role-based Authentication in Jenkins

First, ensure that Jenkins has the necessary permissions to access your GitHub repository. Follow these steps:

- Navigate to Jenkins dashboard.
- Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage and Assign Roles" > "Manage Roles".
- Create a new role named "GitHub Access".
- Assign appropriate permissions to this role, such as "Overall/Read" and "Job/Build".
- Assign this role to the relevant user or group.

## Step 2: Execute Shell Script

Next, we'll create a Jenkins pipeline job to execute shell commands. Follow these steps:

- Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.
- In the pipeline configuration, add a new stage to execute a shell script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Execute Shell') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "hello world"'
                sh 'git clone https://github.com/regression1607/jenkinsdemo.git'
                sh 'cd jenkinsdemo'
                sh 'cat index.html'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Build Pipeline

Now, let's trigger the pipeline to build. Follow these steps:

- Click on "Build Now" in the Jenkins job dashboard.
- Jenkins will start the pipeline execution.
- The shell commands specified in the pipeline will be executed, including cloning the GitHub repository and displaying the contents of the index.html file.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you've successfully set up a Jenkins pipeline integrated with GitHub. This automation allows for seamless deployment of projects and enhances the development workflow.
